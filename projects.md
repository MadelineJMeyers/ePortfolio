## [CS-340-Portfolio-Project-Enhanced](https://github.com/MadelineJMeyers/CS-340-Portfolio-Project-Enhanced)
An enhanced variant of the main project. This was enhanced to create a more modernized look to the application while also enhancing the algorithms to enable a faster search and filter. I have also created more filtering options for a more user-friendly interface while maintaining the functionality from the original portfolio project. These enhancements were chosen to showcase my ability to create a well structured program while also using the JupyterDash Full-Stack model to create a smoothly functioning dashboard application.

## [CS-340-Portfolio-Project-Flask-Fork](https://github.com/MadelineJMeyers/CS-340-Portfolio-Project-Flask-Fork)
Another variant of the main portfolio project which includes previous enhancements to maintain functionality. This version was created using Python, Flask, JavaScript, and React with Node.js as the package manager to handle deployment of the frontend server. This was created to showcase my ability to create not only a well-structured web application but also to create the program in multiple languages. This variant due to how it is structured is easier to scale and was created with modern Full-Stack development practices in mind.
